- Update the app to follow [the specification](../../main.md)
- Build and run the code with `scripts/run`. Avoid asking me to run `go build` or `go test` commands manually.
- Fetch the GitHub home page for each used library to get a documentation and examples. Avoid the weird go code inspections you like to do.

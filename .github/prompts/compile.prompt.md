- Update the app to follow [the specification](../../main.md)
- Validate code you write via the built-in VS Code Go extension. Avoid asking me to allow run `go build` or `go test` commands many times.
- Fetch the GitHub home page for each used library to get a documentation and examples. Avoid the weird go code inspections you like to do.
